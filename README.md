## About Me

I'm an AI Engineer and technical founder working to shape the future of large language models and AI-driven cultural tools. With a background in full-stack development and experience across data pipelines, model evaluation, and applied GenAI, I bring a pragmatic engineering mindset to frontier-level machine learning.

Outside of work, I'm a passionate runner, strength trainer, visual artist, and writer. I believe that discipline, creativity, and clear thinking are transferable across domains — whether in code, canvas, or conversation.

My long-term mission is to become a **leading example of what's possible through focus, work ethic, and curiosity**. I strive to **help and inspire others** — especially underrepresented creators and technologists — to pursue bold, ambitious goals.

I’m also a highly communicative professional: I love meaningful conversations, building deep connections, and speaking in public. Whether in a 1:1, a team sync, or on stage, I bring clarity, energy, and an authentic desire to share knowledge.
